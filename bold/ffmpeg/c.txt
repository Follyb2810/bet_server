You're aiming big — and that's awesome. 🎯
But to be crystal clear upfront: building a **full-featured timeline video editor** in **React Native** is possible — **but it’s complex** and **requires a lot of custom work**.

---

## ⚠️ First, Here's What You're Getting Into

### 🧱 A “full timeline editor” means features like:

| Feature                         | Difficulty     | Notes                                           |
| ------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-track timeline            | 🔴 Hard        | Requires custom scrollable UI and state syncing |
| Drag-and-drop video/audio clips | 🔴 Hard        | Manual gestures and layout updates              |
| Live preview with scrubbing     | 🟡 Medium      | Use `react-native-video`, sync with timeline    |
| Trimming clips on the timeline  | 🟡 Medium      | Build UI, map to FFmpeg command                 |
| Add transitions/effects         | 🟡 Medium–Hard | You can apply with FFmpeg post-processing       |
| Export edited video             | 🟢 Easy        | Done with `ffmpeg-kit-react-native`             |

---

## ✅ Yes, It Can Be Done — Here’s How to Approach It

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Architecture for a Timeline Video Editor

### 1. **Setup Project**

```bash
npx react-native init TimelineEditor
cd TimelineEditor
npm install ffmpeg-kit-react-native react-native-video react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-fs
```

> Expo? Not ideal — FFmpegKit requires native modules, so use React Native CLI.

---

### 2. **Build the Timeline UI (Visually Complex Part)**

Use `FlatList` or custom `ScrollView` to render tracks:

```
TrackArea
│
├── VideoTrack (horizontal scroll)
│   ├── ClipBlock (with thumbnail, start/end time)
│   └── Trim handles (gesture based)
│
├── AudioTrack (optional)
│
└── Playhead (syncs with current video time)
```

> You'll have to build `ClipBlock` as a touchable, resizable view and keep a state of:

```ts
type Clip = {
  id: string;
  uri: string;
  start: number;
  end: number;
  position: number; // on timeline
};
```

---

### 3. **Use `react-native-video` to Preview**

```tsx
<Video
  source={{ uri: selectedClip.uri }}
  ref={videoRef}
  paused={!isPlaying}
  onProgress={({ currentTime }) => setCurrentTime(currentTime)}
  style={{ width: '100%', height: 200 }}
/>
```

Also show a red **playhead** over the timeline that syncs with video position.

---

### 4. **Sync Timeline Actions with FFmpeg**

When trimming or adjusting clip timing, store it in state:

```ts
[
  {
    uri: 'file:///clip1.mp4',
    start: 5,
    end: 10,
  },
  {
    uri: 'file:///clip2.mp4',
    start: 0,
    end: 8,
  }
]
```

Then generate a **FFmpeg command** dynamically to trim and merge clips:

```ts
const generateFFmpegCommand = (clips) => {
  let cmd = '';

  clips.forEach((clip, index) => {
    cmd += `-ss ${clip.start} -to ${clip.end} -i ${clip.uri} `;
  });

  cmd += `-filter_complex "`;
  clips.forEach((_, index) => {
    cmd += `[${index}:v:0][${index}:a:0]`;
  });
  cmd += `concat=n=${clips.length}:v=1:a=1[outv][outa]" -map "[outv]" -map "[outa]" output.mp4`;

  return cmd;
};
```

Then run with:

```ts
await FFmpegKit.execute(command);
```

---

### 5. **Export Final Video**

Once all clip data is stored and user hits “Export”:

* Generate the FFmpeg command
* Execute with FFmpegKit
* Save output to file system using `react-native-fs`

## 🧠 Realistic Plan: Build It in Milestones

| Milestone                                | Description                              |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Phase 1: Import & preview videos       | Pick files, show thumbnails and playback |
| ✅ Phase 2: Timeline with draggable clips | Visual layout and interaction            |
| ✅ Phase 3: Trimming UI + FFmpeg trim     | Sliders/gestures to set in/out           |
| ✅ Phase 4: Merge & export                | FFmpeg logic to generate final video     |
| ✅ Phase 5: Audio tracks & overlays       | Optional, more complex later             |
| ✅ Phase 6: Transitions/effects           | Apply filters/transitions using FFmpeg   |

## 🔥 Want to Start Fast?

If you're serious, I can:

* Give you a minimal starter project with:

  * video import
  * timeline rendering
  * FFmpeg trimming + export

* Help you build it feature by feature

---

Would you like me to generate:

* A basic file structure?
* A starter timeline editor with 1 video clip and trim/export?
* Or just keep explaining each piece in detail?

Let’s build this one step at a time. 🚀
