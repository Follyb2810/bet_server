‚úÖ Yes, **absolutely** ‚Äî you can build a **React Native app** that converts video to audio, trims, cuts, or even streams video/audio using **FFmpeg** ‚Äî with a few considerations.

## üîß What‚Äôs Possible in React Native with FFmpeg?

### You can do things like:

* üéß Convert `.mp4` ‚Üí `.mp3`
* ‚úÇÔ∏è Cut/Trim videos
* üìê Resize or compress videos
* üîÅ Extract frames
* üì§ Prepare media for upload

## ‚úÖ How to Use FFmpeg in React Native?

There are **two main ways** to integrate FFmpeg into a **React Native** app:

---

### 1. **Use `react-native-ffmpeg` (now `ffmpeg-kit-react-native`)**

This is the best option for mobile apps ‚Äî it's a **native wrapper** around the FFmpeg libraries.

#### üì¶ Install:

```bash
npm install ffmpeg-kit-react-native
```

> üìå iOS and Android native builds are required, so you'll need to run with Xcode or Android Studio at least once.

---

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Example: Convert video to audio

```ts
import { FFmpegKit } from 'ffmpeg-kit-react-native';

const convertVideoToAudio = async (videoPath: string, outputPath: string) => {
  const command = `-i ${videoPath} -vn -acodec libmp3lame ${outputPath}`;
  await FFmpegKit.execute(command).then(async (session) => {
    const returnCode = await session.getReturnCode();
    if (returnCode.isValueSuccess()) {
      console.log('Conversion successful');
    } else {
      console.log('Conversion failed');
    }
  });
};
```

---

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Example: Trim video

```ts
const trimVideo = async (inputPath: string, outputPath: string) => {
  const command = `-ss 00:00:05 -t 00:00:10 -i ${inputPath} -c copy ${outputPath}`;
  await FFmpegKit.execute(command);
};
```

---

### 2. Use a **backend** with Node.js and FFmpeg (optional)

If you don‚Äôt want to process videos on the phone (due to performance), you can:

* Upload the video to a server
* Use Node.js with `fluent-ffmpeg`
* Return the processed file

‚úÖ Great for heavy tasks like merging, compressing large files.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

| Concern        | Notes                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Performance    | FFmpeg is **CPU intensive**, especially on mobile. Test performance on real devices.                                                |
| Permissions    | React Native will need access to files: use `react-native-permissions` and `react-native-fs`.                                       |
| Native Modules | You‚Äôll need to build for Android/iOS (no Expo unless you eject).                                                                    |
| App Size       | FFmpeg library adds \~50MB+ to your app build. Use [FFmpegKit packages](https://github.com/tanersener/ffmpeg-kit) to minimize size. |

---

## üß† Summary

| Task                    | FFmpegKit Support                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Convert Video to MP3    | ‚úÖ Yes                                  |
| Trim or Cut Video       | ‚úÖ Yes                                  |
| Compress/Resize Video   | ‚úÖ Yes                                  |
| Merge Video/Audio Files | ‚úÖ Yes                                  |
| Live Streaming          | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially (requires advanced setup) |
